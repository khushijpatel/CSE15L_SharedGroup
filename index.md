# Groupwork
**Hello!**

Task: 
Imagine that you were working on some code in a project and you find out your teammate was also working on the same file (but maybe some other lines of code). 
How would you get your files to sync with each other? Play out this scenario with your teammate and write down what steps both of you will take!
